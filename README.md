# vehicle-dashboard-frontend
The frontend of the Vehicle Dashboard Interface is built with React, providing a dynamic UI that displays real-time data from a  serverless (API gateway, Lambda) cloud-hosted backend on AWS. Users can interact with elements like motor speed sliders and charging buttons, which update the backend and reflect changes instantly on the dashboard.

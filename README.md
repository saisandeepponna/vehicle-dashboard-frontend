# Vehicle-dashboard-frontend
The frontend of the Vehicle Dashboard Interface is built with React, providing a dynamic UI that displays real-time data from a  serverless (API gateway, Lambda) cloud-hosted backend on AWS. Users can interact with elements like motor speed sliders and charging buttons, which update the backend and reflect changes instantly on the dashboard.



# Technologies Used:
React: The frontend of the application is built using React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
CSS : Styling is achieved using CSS  to ensure a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate layout that mimics a vehicle dashboard.
Axios: Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the backend API, allowing the frontend to interact with the MySQL RDS database on AWS in real-time and update the UI accordingly.

# Setup
just npm install for node modules, npm start to run server at 3000 port.
